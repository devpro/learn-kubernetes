> Perform behavioral analytics of syscall process and file activities at the host and container level to detect malicious activities  
> Detect threats within physical infrastructure, apps, networks, data, users and workloads  
> Detect all phases of attack regardless where it occurs and how it spreads  
> Perform deep analytical investigation and identification of bad actors within environment  
> Ensure immutability of containers at runtime  
> Use Audit Logs to monitor access
