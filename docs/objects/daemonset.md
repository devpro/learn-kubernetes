# Kubernetes DaemonSet object

[Kubernetes Documentation/Concepts/Workloads/Workload Resources/DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)

> A **DaemonSet** ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

## Manifest examples

- A DaemonSet that runs the fluentd-elasticsearch Docker image
